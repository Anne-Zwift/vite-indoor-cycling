# üì¶ My Social Media App


## üåü Highlights

- The front-end will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on their own posts.
- Features such as following/unfollowing users, commenting on posts, and reacting to a post with an emoji.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This is a front-end for a social media application, it is a single-page application built with Vite and JavaScript. 

### The pages included are:
- Login page.
- Register page.
- Posts/feed page.
- Individual post page.
- User‚Äôs own profile page.

### Out of Scope:
The importance of this assignment is to demonstrate JavaScript. Therfore it will not be an amazing design for the project, just some basic styling in place.

## System Architecture:

### Backend Context
The backend server is hosted externally and is not part of this repository. All API requests are from the client directed to the base Url defined in `src\constants.ts`.
The application follows a Three-Tier Monolithic architecure by connecting to a remote, unified Node.js/Express API backend by PostgreSQL. This repository contains only the client-side code.

### Component Breakdown:

**Browser(Client):** The Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Vite and TypeScript. It communicates with the Server via API calls.<br>
**Server(Monolith):** A single external Node.js/Express application that hosts all business logic (Auth, Posts, Routing) and serves the API endpoints.<br>
**Database(PostgreSQL):** The external persistent data store used by the Server.<br>
